# Credit card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the use of supervised machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions in financial data. It focuses on addressing the real-world challenge of class imbalance using multiple resampling techniques and evaluating model performance using a robust pipeline.

##  Overview

Financial fraud is rare but costly, making accurate detection critical. In this project, I apply different balancing techniques combined with classification models to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions.

---

##  Objectives

- Explore and visualize transaction data
- Address severe class imbalance using:
  - SMOTE (oversampling)
  - NearMiss (undersampling)
  - SMOTE-ENN (combined technique)
- Evaluate models using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

---

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

### 1. Preprocessing
- Standard scaling with `StandardScaler`
- Class balancing with `SMOTE`, `NearMiss`, and `SMOTE-ENN`
- Dimensionality reduction using `LinearDiscriminantAnalysis`

### 2. Modeling
- `RandomForestClassifier` trained within a `Pipeline`
- Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`
- Cross-validation via `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`
- Evaluation using `cross_val_score` and classification metrics

##  Dataset

The dataset used is a publicly available anonymized set of European credit card transactions from 2013. It is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions making up less than 0.2% of all data.

- **File name**: `data/creditcard.csv`
- **Rows**: 284,807
- **Fraudulent cases**: 492
- **Legit transactions**: 284,315
- **Features**:
  - `Time`, `Amount`
  - `V1` to `V28`: Principal components from PCA (sensitive features obscured)
  - `Class`: Binary target (0 = Non-Fraud, 1 = Fraud)
